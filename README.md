IMPORTANT TOPICS FOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS:-
What are rcommender systems ?
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them. 
The recommender system deals with a large volume of information present by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user and other factors that take care of the userâ€™s preference and interest. It finds out the match between user and item and imputes the similarities between users and items for recommendation. 


Why the Recommendation system?
Benefits users in finding items of their interest.
Help item providers in delivering their items to the right user.
Identity products that are most relevant to users.
Personalized content.
Help websites to improve user engagement.

 
What can be Recommended?
There are many different things that can be recommended by the system like movies, books, news, articles, jobs, advertisements, etc. Netflix uses a recommender system to recommend movies & web-series to its users. Similarly, YouTube recommends different videos. There are many examples of recommender systems that are widely used today.
 
 
 Types of Recommendation System :-
1. Popularity-Based Recommendation System:-
It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is in trend. These systems check about the product or movie which are in trend or are most popular among the users and directly recommend those.
For example, if a product is often purchased by most people then the system will get to know that that product is most popular so for every new user who just signed it, the system will recommend that product to that user also and chances becomes high that the new user will also purchase that. 

2. Classification Model :-
 The model that uses features of both products as well as users to predict whether a user will like a product or not.
 
 3. Content-Based Recommendation System:-
It is another type of recommendation system which works on the principle of similar content. If a user is watching a movie, then the system will check about other movies of similar content or the same genre of the movie the user is watching. There are various fundamentals attributes that are used to compute the similarity while checking about similar content. 

4. Collaborative Filtering :-
It is considered to be one of the very smart recommender systems that work on the similarity between different users and also items that are widely used as an e-commerce website and also online movie websites. It checks about the taste of similar users and does recommendations. 
The similarity is not restricted to the taste of the user moreover there can be consideration of similarity between different items also. The system will give more efficient recommendations if we have a large volume of information about users and items.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine of the angle between the two vectors of the item, vectors of A and B is calculated for imputing similarity. If the vectors are closer, then small will be the angle and large will be the cosine. 

Tags-
A tag recommender system is a recommender system which recommends tags to the user. In this context, a tag is defined as a word freely added to an object by a user. Usually there is no limitation on the amount of tags that can be added to an object

Text Vectorization-
Vectorization or word embedding is the process of converting text data to numerical vectors. Later those vectors are used to build various machine learning models. In this manner, we say this as extracting features with the help of text with an aim to build multiple natural languages, processing models, etc
